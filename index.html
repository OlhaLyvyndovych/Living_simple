            <p class="art-title">My name is John and living the simple life saved my life</p>
            <p><span>I used to be a pack rat.</span> I had so many things that I thought that I loved,
                but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate any of it because there
                 was too much. Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a
                 home that I didn't want to live in, and I couldn't hold a relationship.</p>
            <p class="sub-heading">How I turned things around</p>
            <p><span>I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything.</span> I literally put 90% of my possessions in
                 the garbage, sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment,
                 and I quit my job. It wasn't easy at all, but everything around
                 me was in such a bad place, I didn't know what else to do. And
                 it worked.
            <p class="sub-heading">Now I live the simple life</p>
            <p> Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life
                  and work more, and I have more free time to enjoy. With how much
                   it turned my life around, <span>I felt like I had no choice but to start
                   sharing how I did it,</span> and how others can benefit from living a
                   simple life as well, which is why I started this site!</p>
